# Roshambo / Rock-Paper-Scissors
> [!NOTE]
> Rock-Paper-Scissors is a classic game that can be played by two people. The game is played by each player simultaneously forming one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors".

## How to play

1. Each player chooses one of the three shapes: rock, paper, or scissors.
2. The players reveal their choices at the same time.
3. The winner is determined by the following rules: Rock beats scissors (rock crushes scissors), Scissors beats paper (scissors cuts paper), Paper beats rock (paper covers rock)
4. If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied.

## History of Rock-Paper-Scissors

The origins of Rock-Paper-Scissors can be traced back to China. The earliest known reference to the game dates back to the Han Dynasty (206 BC â€“ 220 AD). Back then, the game was called "shoushiling" and used different hand gestures to represent the concepts. The game spread throughout Asia, with variations emerging in different regions. In Japan, the game known as "janken" emerged in the 17th century and used the familiar rock, paper, and scissors gestures. This version of the game became the foundation for the modern Rock-Paper-Scissors known worldwide. Rock-Paper-Scissors only reached the Western world in the early 20th century, primarily due to increased contact with Japan. The English name itself comes from translating the Japanese names for the three hand gestures.
